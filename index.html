        <h2>Meet Ansh: The YOLO Kid</h2>
        <p>
            People know him as a guy who never misses a deadline. Or a class. Or a question in the exam. The perfect student, son, and friend.
            Has never done anything illegal in his whole life.

        <h2>Meet Nauman: The Paranoid Kid</h2>
        <p>
            Everything scares him. If you watch a horror movie with him for five minutes you need to accompany him to the bathroom for the next 2 days.
            If there is one thing in the world he hates, that's germs and microbes. Rumors have it he has never been sick in his life.

        <h2>Meet Yoki: The Kid With the Hero Syndrome</h2>
        <p>
            She was raised believing she would be a hero one day. You are chased by a stalker? She is the detective. You lost your wallet?
            She will throw herlself under a train or beyond to retrieve it. She holds a strong belief that the world will need her one day.
            And that she will be hero we need, but not one we deserve.

        <h2>Meet Maryam: The Rich Kid</h2>
        <p>
            Very comfortable single kid with a lot of connections and power. You are a friend of hers and need that visa to travel for your winter break
            but the logistics are too complicated? She makes one call. People look up to her. She normally looks down on them. If a ship is sinking she
            will be one of the first people who will be saved by the emergency units. Not your typical favorite kid.

        <h2>Did we, really?</h2>
        <p> Yes. We made it. We sent four people to the pre-pandemic time to change the timeline with the help of their past selves.
            <br>Follow the story of the rich kid, the paranoid kid, the YOLO kid and the bat killer kid to see how they react to their
            future selves and try to save the world in their own way.
            
        </p>
        <h2>Did the four people sent to the past with time machine succeed?</h2>
        <p>This you should ask the scientist. He just released the discoveries today and avioded press. Don't believe the rumors. 
            Scary news are everywhere these days. Go to his website at <a href="time_machine.html">www.madscientist.com</a> to know what exactly happened to the
            four people who went back in time.

        <q>You simply don't do two things: touch your face when you are outside and mess with the timeline.
        </q> <p>is all the mad scientist said when asked about the time machine operations.</p>
